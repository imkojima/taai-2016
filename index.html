  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p>The 2016 Conference on Technologies and Applications of Artificial Intelligence (TAAI 2016) is the 21st annual conference sponsored by the Taiwanese Association for Artificial Intelligence (TAAI) and one of the most important annual academic meetings on Artificial Intelligence in Taiwan.
  <p>The conference will be held during <span style="color:red;">25-27 November, 2016</span> in Hsinchu, Taiwan.</p>
  <p>The conference is open to international participants, and the number of international participants from various countries increases constantly in the past few years. For instance, the Japanese Society for Artificial Intelligence (JSAI) and the TAAI association promoted exchange visits in the earlier JSAI annual meetings and the TAAI conferences.</p>
  <p>The purpose of TAAI conference is to bring together researchers, engineers, and practitioners to present and exchange ideas, results, and experiences in AI technologies and applications. Topics of particular interest include, but are not limited to:</p>
